Ecrotek is a beekeeping supplies company based in Auckland. I worked with them to facilitate a rebranding and new website launch. They release a 44-page biannual catalogue (shown below), which was designed and formatted by myself. The catalogue also features advertisements, which were also designed by me.&nbsp;

Below are some examples of work that was created for them.
