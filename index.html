			<p class="editable">
				"Lucy helped us to develop a brand that helped us to use across all of our visual marketing; including a banner that was erected across our main street, posters, flyers and numerous other visuals we required for display on the big screen on the night of the event. Through all of this she was very <strong>reliable, very prompt, and efficient</strong> and was happy to make the many small changes we required as plans evolved. <strong>I would happily and easily recommend Lucy for any visual design project.</strong>"<br /><br />-Scott Smith,&nbsp;<em>King Country Christmas</em>
